Hi!
I'm PhD student at Purdue University ECE, the <a href='https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ips/'>Video and Image Processing Lab</a>.
I work on the intersection of data compression, computer vision, and machine learning.
My research goal is to develop methods that **(compression by AI)** use deep learning to improve visual data compression, **(compression for AI)** design compression methods that are tailored to downstream vision tasks, and **(AI by compression)** use compression as a tool to improve downstream vision tasks performance.

**Education:** I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), China, in 2018. I received my Master's degree in ECE from [Boston University](https://www.bu.edu/eng/academics/departments-and-divisions/electrical-and-computer-engineering/), USA, in 2020.
